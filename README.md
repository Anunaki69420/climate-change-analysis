# climate-change-analysis
This project focuses on analyzing climate change indicators through Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and data visualization. It integrates Named Entity Recognition (NER) and text summarization to extract key entities and generate concise summaries from large textual datasets. Additionally, the project includes comprehensive visualizations, such as trends in COâ‚‚ emissions, population distribution, and climate-related events, to uncover insights from structured data. By combining advanced NLP and data analysis techniques, this project aims to provide actionable insights into global climate change indicators.

Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifies domain-specific entities like "carbon emissions" and "renewable energy" using a pre-trained model and custom entity matching.
Text Summarization: Generates concise summaries of climate-related reports using the Hugging Face facebook/bart-large-cnn model.
Data Analysis and Visualization
Interactive Tools: Combines textual insights with visual data exploration for a holistic understanding.
